# Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning on the Titanic Dataset

This project focuses on evaluating and fine-tuning various machine learning models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The primary goal is to apply hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- To preprocess and clean the Titanic dataset.
- To build and train several classification models to predict survival.
- To perform hyperparameter tuning on the selected models to improve their accuracy.
- To evaluate and compare the performance of the tuned models using various metrics.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC score
