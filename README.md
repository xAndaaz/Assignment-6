# Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning on the Titanic Dataset

This project focuses on evaluating and fine-tuning various machine learning models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. The primary goal is to apply hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like age, sex, class, and whether they survived or not. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

- To preprocess and clean the Titanic dataset.
- To build and train several classification models to predict survival.
- To perform hyperparameter tuning on the selected models to improve their accuracy.
- To evaluate and compare the performance of the tuned models using various metrics.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC score



## Results and Conclusion

The results of the model evaluations and the impact of hyperparameter tuning are documented within the Jupyter Notebook. The conclusion summarizes the findings and discusses the effectiveness of different models and tuning strategies for this particular dataset.
